# Optimizing Sequential Predictions for Order Execution: a Decision-Focused Learning Approach

## Getting Started

python main.py --dfl yes --config configs.yml

But, there is no Trade and Quote (TAQ) dataset which does not open. 
If you have your own dataset, you save that at own directory in min-interval trading data. The dataset must have at least 3 columns; date, time and volume.
